This repo is now born because i started using neovim for my personal projects at home. After a few days(still finding really hard opened for advice to better understand it) i thought that i frequently solve leetCode problems and I really dislike about myself that when i m writing even unit testing i m always vibeCoding the tests. Taking all this into consideration i decided to publish my solution and my explications. I feel like using more neovim will help me understand and train my muscle memory faster. Also understanding unit testing is a really important skill (i think my senior at work said that is not that important) to master giving the fact that i was just promoted to mid software engineer and smh i never wrote a single test until today by myself. If you have any advice for writing tests or using vim please inform me.

For peaople who just want to take the repo and test it localy (to see specific solution):
1. git clone <url>
2. npm i (assuming you guys have npm && node)
3. npm run test -- ./teast/problemNumber.test.js

If you want to add your own explination or optimize my solution feel free to make a pull request and i will check it 100%
Have a nice day
