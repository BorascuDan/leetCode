# Intuition

Highly recommend to solve 2 sum first. The solution is to keep one pointer in place and for the rest of the array just solve 2 sum.

# Approach

First we sort the array. After that you pass through all the elements. If the first element is greater then 0, obviously the following elements will not solve the request so we can break the flow right there. Second check should be if the current element is equal to the previous encountered one. We do this to remove possible duplicate answers. Then after setting that pointer in place we just solve 2 sum for the rest of the array. Just remember if you do find an element that matches the requirements you should also remove the possible duplicate requirements.  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:O(n^2) -> because for each element we solve the 2 sum witch is O(n) so it results in O(n*n)
- Space complexity:O(1) -> if we don't take into consideration the result array. If we take that into consideration it becomes O(n) triplets (i think i m not sure about that please correct me if i am wrong thank you)

# Code

```javascript []

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
export const threeSum = (nums) => {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let res = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    //if the first number is bigger then 0 there will be no pair of 2 numbers summing up to 0 beacause we sorted the string
    if (nums[i] > 0) break;
    //remove all numbers that will be repeted as starting point(constraints)
    while (i != 0 && nums[i - 1] === nums[i]) i += 1;

    //2 sum solution + constrain of repeting solutions
    let [left, right] = [i + 1, nums.length - 1];
    while (left < right) {
      const curentSum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
      if (curentSum > 0) {
        right -= 1;
      } else if (curentSum < 0) {
        left += 1;
      } else {
        res.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);
        left += 1; right -= 1;

        while (nums[left - 1] === nums[left] && left < right) left += 1;
      }
    }
  }

  return res;
};
```
